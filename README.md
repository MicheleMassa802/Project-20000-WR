# Virtual Batting Cage

Making use of Unity to simulate a real batting cage environment and some funky image analysis, Project 20000 WR captures the motion of a user’s “batting object” and recreates their swing in the simulation, resulting in an interactive batting cage like experience.

The inspiration for this project is Wii Sports baseball, and I can only wish I can get to such a good product given the restriction of not using sensors or a controller in general. After a base implementation is done, I would like to push this project into a VR setting.
